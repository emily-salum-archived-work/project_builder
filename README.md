# project_builder

Program that can be used to define dinamic forms in a tkinter interface to fill content that would be used in other programs.

## Technologies Used

Python, Tkinter, MongoDB, cryptography.

## Goal

Connecting different helper projects of mine that used similar data.


# Finished Implementations:

- Define the form structure, with: Text Inputs, Checkboxes, List Menus and Option Menus.
- Link different filling boxes. 
- Once a form is saved, it calls .exe files related to that form, turning this into a global interface for any number of projects.
